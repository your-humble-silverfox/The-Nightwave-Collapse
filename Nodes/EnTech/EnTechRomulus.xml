After finally receiving the entire project source code from my predecessor and analyzing it, I have come to the conclusion of the project being impossible to finish in its current state.
Previous developer made a plethora of basic mistakes that now plague the project, making it an unoptimized mess. The "questionable" variable naming of the previous developer has rendered any salvaging of the source code impossible as well.
The only viable solution is to move the deadline on the project forward and/or increase the team and funding provided so that the project can be restarted from scratch.

  <file path="STORE/Contractors/Optograph" name="Mainframe_Password_OptographReport1.txt">Security Concerns - Password Updates on Mainframe Server
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention some pressing security concerns regarding our mainframe server. It has come to my attention that there hasn't been any recent password updates, which poses a significant risk to our network's security.
Outdated passwords are an open invitation to potential cyberattacks. This issue is especially worrisome given the sensitive data and critical systems hosted on our mainframe server. Unauthorized access to this information could result in severe consequences for our organization.
Considering the nature of how we get problems solved here, I also uploaded my chat log with MinistMole about the issue, to point out that it's not just "my antics" playing up, but a general concern.</file>

  <file path="STORE/Contractors/Optograph" name="irc_log_515.log">
[Optograph]: MinistMole, have you checked EnTech_Zeus lately? I'm getting concerned about the lack of password updates.
[MinistMole]: Hey Optograph, yeah, I noticed that too. It's been way too long since we last changed those passwords. It's been "v19328hQ9" since I got hired. What's going on?
[Optograph]: Not sure, but it's definitely a security risk. I think we should bring this up with our supervisor ASAP. Outdated passwords are a hacker's dream.
[MinistMole]: I agree. We need to take action fast. I'll draft an email to our supervisor outlining the situation. Do you have any suggestions on how to address this issue?
[Optograph]: Great, let's get on that email. I think we should stress the potential risks associated with unchanged passwords, such as unauthorized access and data breaches. We could also recommend a regular schedule for password updates to ensure this doesn't happen again.
[MinistMole]: Solid points, Optograph. I'll also highlight that failing to update passwords is a violation of our company's security policies and potentially a breach of compliance standards.
[Optograph]: Good thinking. Let's make it clear that we take this issue seriously and that it needs immediate attention. We should also offer to help with the password updates if necessary.

Not sure how long you wanted this report to be, so i'll be keeping it pretty curt.
Progress is good - my section's progressing mostly as planned - in that it works, and it's passing most of your test cases (#86 though - what is that? Hint?).
I've run into a few issues that require me to decentralize it - new versions of it will talk to a "Heart" server, which will crunch and send back solutions to some of these tricker cases, being able to ping them for a second perspective. I think this'll give me some more options to get around stuff like whitelist servers.
I've got this thing running, and there's my Heart link prototype uploaded here too.

You gave me pretty free reign, so I assume this is fine, let me know if there are problems.

Update Report:
---------------

Good news - things are well ahead of schedule. Turns out I can just rip a bunch of the source code of the WINE project for unix and use that for a lot of the tricker problems.

Programs from standard unix are running fine - cross distro issues were much less of a problem than I thought, given our kernel access here - I can fake a few things and write wrappers for the rest and it all just sort of plugs in nicely. I dont see those being a problem.
Other OS's have always been the problem, and with our framework we're not going to be able to run literally anything, but with this WINE solution, I've already been able to hack up something that runs most terminal applications - .NET and C# are totally fine (thanks mono project), C++ works depending on some libs and compiler choices.
Flat C is giving me the most issues, but given that I know what sort of stuff to expect (lots of network access right?) it's coming along ok.

All in all, very promising, we should have a universal executable runner up and running soon. And by us I mean me - I'll have it up and running.

Hacknet Project Report 04:

--Additional task this week is complete. 
SecurityTracer.exe is uploaded here and should be packaged with all new Hacknet releases as a temporary measure while the full project is in the works.
It's a bandaid solution, but it should auto-activate, disable the user's copy and send it's location (IP and geographic) to your central servers after a copy's started up and running for a while.

--Plans for a deeper integrated, invisible SecurityTracer are coming along
Progress delayed to aid in completing TraceTracker in time for the next milestone.

--Trace Tracker v0.93 released.
Release candidate for final version. Successfully passing all 92 provided test cases, and passing 22 / 25 of my own cases.
This successfully tracks and estimates pingbacks and trace times all known automatic tracking software, and provides a (relatively speaking) very close estimate to how much time can be spent before an automatic emergency sequence can be engaged.

I want to take this opportunity to re-iterate the power of this piece of technology. Even without updates, this is an incredibly useful tool, and I recommend it's strict moderation with the tools I've provided. I'll be examining builds to ensure this.

Thanks,
teja
