Hi Riley,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to ask you to help me out with making a list of our old data at Romulus server that needs retaining, and what can be deleted. Not sure I can directly send you the server info, our security API's going crazy on forwarding Ben's emails. So check them out in my account, the pass is "JubAWJUR". Once you're logged in, you'll find the email with the subject "Server Shutdown and Old Project Files - Urgent" in the inbox.

Thank you for your help with this, and let me know if you need any further assistance.

Best,
Amelia

Ben,

Great, I'll make sure to have that list ready for our meeting. It's a mix of project files, some of which are still relevant, and others that can be archived or deleted, so I'll categorize them accordingly.

I appreciate your cooperation on this. See you at 10 AM in the IT conference room.

Amelia,

Thank you for your cooperation as well. I'll be ready to discuss the technical aspects of shutting down the Romulus server and the best practices for data security. Let's make sure this transition goes smoothly.

See you at 10 AM.

Best regards,

Ben,

Thank you for your prompt response. I think a meeting is a good idea. How about tomorrow at 10 AM in the IT conference room? Does that work for you?

-Amelia

Amelia,

That time works for me. I'll be there at 10 AM tomorrow in the IT conference room. In the meantime, it would be helpful if you could prepare a list of the project files that need to be retained and those that can be safely archived or deleted. This will help us streamline the process. I think you should be able to access the server with the password "h7ggNKl2", it should help you make the list.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Hey Ben,

I hope this email finds you well. As you know, we've successfully completed the transition to our new location, and it's time to address the Romulus server, the one at 156.151.1.12, which still houses some old project files. I wanted to discuss the process for shutting it down and ensuring data security. Do you have a moment to chat about this?

Best regards,
-Amelia

Hi Amelia,

Great to hear from you. I'm aware of the Romulus server situation, and I agree it's essential to handle it properly. Let's discuss it. How about we schedule a meeting to go over the details? What time works for you?

Best regards,
-Ben

Hi Riley,

I'm on it. I'll start by checking the logs and monitoring our network traffic. If this is indeed an attempted breach, we need to act fast to identify the source and plug any vulnerabilities. I'll keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Amelia,

I hope this message finds you well. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we've got a potentially serious security issue on our hands. Our security systems just detected an unusual spike in network traffic and some unauthorized access attempts. This could be the precursor to a breach.

I need your immediate assistance in investigating this matter further. Could you please take a look into our logs and see if you can identify the source of these anomalies?

    <email recipient="nstanford" sender="EnTech Management" subject="Hacknet Project Update">
Hello all,

Let me first say that progress has been exceptional. Despite some setbacks we ran into with the connections module, we've come out of it still within our goal deadline margins. You've all done great work. Some of the trouble points we established early on are being addressed by some outside contractors, who are showing impressive results!

The project has been, I think, enlightening for everyone, and continues to reinforce my thoughts that this is the right way to address the problems digital security has at the moment.
By pushing current systems to the limits like this ourselves, we've made huge bounds in progress of EnSec development and theory - the projects are helping each other now more than ever, and it's so encouraging to see.

More updates soon to come,
Keep up the good work,

    <email recipient="nstanford" sender="EnTech Management" subject="Hacknet Project concerns and responses">
Hello all,
One of our engineers has expressed concerns about the direction of the project. I quote:
"If used maliciously, this could be an extremely dangerous tool we're building. Unless you can guarantee that distribution will be extremely carefully tracked and monitored, I'm not sure I can continue work on the project in good faith".

It's an exceptional point, and in the interests of transparency, something I want to talk about with the whole company.
As I said before, this distribution locking and tracking was something we Identified early on in the design as something troublesome. One of the inherent problems with building powerful tools is their misuse comes with powerful consequences. This problem area is one of the instances where I felt engaging outside expert's help was our best course of action, and they are one of the ones showing great results.
While I don't have the finished product to demonstrate yet, rest assured that it's an issue I'm aware of, and want to keep talking about. For now, *all* build come with a security tracer embedded that automatically activates at random intervals, helping track rogue builds even in this early stage.

Keep up the good work,
-RC

Hey,

You probably should have been set up with this at the start, but the Romulus admin pass is:

h7ggNKl2

You should have a link to it on your desktop, but if you don't connect to 156.151.1.12 and you should be good to go.

    <email recipient="nstanford" sender="Hacknet team Management" subject="Welcome to the Hacknet Team">
Hello, and welcome to the Hacknet team. Due to the delicate nature of the project, much of your participation in the team will be kept isolated from other components in the project, and seeing complete assembled builds of the project will be rare, if ever.
Because of this, we wanted to give everyone a bit more context as to the project's overall goals.

Hackent OS has been designed from the ground up as a groundbreaking computer security examination and penetration testing framework.
EnTech is producing this as a companion to it's new digital security software suite (EnSec), as a marketing and presentation device to demonstrate it's superiority over conventional security packages.
At it's heart, hacknet is a marketing device, but as an individual project it's one of the most ambitious and powerful AntiSec tools ever created.

Welcome to the team - I'm sure you'll agree it's an incredibly exciting project to be a part of.

    <email recipient="nstanford" sender="EnTech Management" subject="EnTech Current projects and Direction">
Greetings, and welcome to EnTech!
We're currently working on two big projects, and you'll be getting a more detailed project introduction for your team shortly, but this email is for an overview of our current direction and how the projects fit together.
The first is EnSec, a completely new computer security suite, designed to revolutionize computer security. Human error will always be the problem area of any security system, but we believe it should be the *only* problem area. By removing and minimizing the potential for human error in the system, and using our new proprietary systems, digital security's no longer a job - it's a choice.
Hacknet OS is the companion project for EnSec, written to demonstrate existing problems with security and provide a strong value proposition for everyone to upgrade to what we believe is truly the best security option.

Welcome aboard!

      A former employee's gone rogue and is threatening the project. Unlike most I'm actually concerned that he knows what he's doing and could be a real problem. As much as I hate being so crude about it, This project is too important to me, and to the world to put it at risk over something like this. Can you discourage him?
