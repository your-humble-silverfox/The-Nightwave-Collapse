            <Block>cr4zy_R3I7: Why in the hell wasn't I informed you planned this, 0rz?
0rz: Consider yourself well informed now, Red
cr4zy_R3I7: Oh it is really fucking helpful now, 0rz, but you're a week late and an operative short. There were three of them, we only found 2.
0rz: Then go, point yourself in that direction and fix it, dammit
cr4zy_R3I7: Then who the fuck fixes you then, eh?
0rz: I don't need fixing, Red. I'm a loyalist defending the world from corporate tyranny
cr4zy_R3I7: You're protecting your own fucking arse.
0rz: I'm doing what needs to be done, no one can hold me back with a roll of red tape. I know what's best for the cause
cr4zy_R3I7: You've lost your mind, 0rz. 
0rz: And you've forgotten what we're fighting for, Red. When doing good you're always doing bad. We fuck up - we bury it, no matter the collateral
cr4zy_R3I7: But we don't bury eachother now, do we, 0rz?
0rz: You've gotta turn that part of your mind the fuck off and face down the real enemy of ours
cr4zy_R3I7: You need to call off your Strife.
0rz: Providence...? Ahahahah. He's a man with a mission, and I highly recommend you don't try and jeopardize it
cr4zy_R3I7: This is your last time to change your mind, 0rz
0rz: Then what?
cr4zy_R3I7: Then after they go for him, they'll come for us all, 0rz. You're gonna kill us all
0rz: Then we're even.
