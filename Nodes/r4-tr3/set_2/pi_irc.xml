        <post user="COrgen">Well, I feel like the police are doing their work, but I'm still keeping an eye on it.</post>
        <post user="JHalcyon">Got a feeling it's over?</post>
        <post user="COrgen">It's been three months, John. Best that can happen is we never find him, ever.</post>
        <post user="COrgen">Stuff like this is why I left the department, remember?</post>
        <post user="JHalcyon">Well, perhaps. Anyway. There's something too... wrong about this Providence case</post>
        <post user="JHalcyon">Information vaporizes before my eyes. Got a bad feeling about this.</post>
