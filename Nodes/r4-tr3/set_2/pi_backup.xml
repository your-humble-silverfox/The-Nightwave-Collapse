                <Block>Dossier for @Cr4zy_R3I7 by Halcyon Private Investigations LLC

Names:
Note: The asset's name appeared impossible to pinpoint, however, through the databases of FBI and Interpol, we managed to identify the following names as his possible aliases:
Mick Steiner - left by the suspects of the Louvre raid last year
Claus von Coevorden - leaked by FBI's informer
Hunter Wolff - mentioned in Interpol Art Theft annual internal evaluation for 2017

Occupation:
As you are well aware, Providence has a big reputation for his art heists and, recently, hacking activities, allegedly going under the nickname Reigning_Strife.
Although, I can't verify the data I was able to find, it was literally vaporizing before my eyes. So his info is now squeaky clean. I'd advise caution during any interactions with him.
There's another thing, among Providence is known for his love for retro cars, Porsche specifically, so he's been in a lot of events, and own a couple, even a Singer DLS.
I have attached some photos of his cars to this dossier.

Ongoing plans (to-be-deleted-later):
- Find some form of contact details
- Identify IPs from Interpol archives
- Connect the dots
- Meet with informer
