Hey, darling...

It's been a year already, I know. If you were here you'd tell me I went crazy. Leaving messages for a dead man that won't ever see them.
Maybe I did, who knows, maybe I actually lost my mind. It was the best time of my life, taken away by a recklessness of a script-kiddie.

If I had ever known what that cunt would pull off. "Leaving our names in history", fucking cunt, not understanding the boundaries. 
There's always a place for idiots. If you're somehow reading this, forgive me... I really couldn't do anything to save you.

            <Block>[@providence] At least we know your funeral will be a civil service
[@bonsoirsaynara] As you never knew it would happen?
[@providence] You two wanted a job, I provided you with one. 
[@bonsoirsaynara] There wasn't any warnings about how we were messing with, and about that kid you recommended.
[@providence] Honestly, read the company policy. You were warned that there's no record on the guy, and that he didn't fuck up *yet*, which made him an option
[@bonsoirsaynara] And how are you going to explain it to your employers?
[@providence] I prefer to word it as some "mortal-middle-management", although it sucks I am not having an employer on this one.
[@bonsoirsaynara] You're insufferable. My time's over, I get it. Not Jintech, then your associates. But don't you dare touching Mael, Rai's not aware of all this.
[@providence] I'm looking for data. My data, that you lost. Everyone who has it is will save on the hearse
[@bonsoirsaynara] You fucking muppet
[@providence] Nothing personal, my policy is "satisfaction guaranteed", especially mine.
