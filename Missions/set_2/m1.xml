We have information of a hackersquad making experimental cracking tool, seize it.
----
Our asset provided us with information about a hackersquad that is allegedly developing a new tool that could prove rather useful in our upcoming operation.
As you might've guessed, we're interested in acquiring said tool, or whatever developments they might have on it. Having other agents occupied, this one is for you, Pretence.
I've got a little report about it laying in our drop-server. You look like a fine, upstanding representative of our profession, so time to show your worth, unless you want an express trip to the hearse.
Go there for your rota, fill up your quota, but watch for marauders.
